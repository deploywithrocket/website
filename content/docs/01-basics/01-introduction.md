* Zero downtime deployments
* Integrates with GitHub, with public or private repositories
* Push to deploy
* Shared directories and `cron` jobs sync
* Ready to use presets for most frameworks (soon)

## Understanding the need

In short: If you are familiar with online code deployment tools, this system is an alternative that bring the benefits of an online tool, for free.

### Problem

Deployments are a hassle.

Eg. using Laravel, you're supposed to put your application into maintenance mode before deploying with `php artisan down`, pull in your code, clear caches, install packages, build assets, restart services, etc.

While you wait, you run `sl` in another terminal. Finally you put the application back up. Sh*t! You forgot to run the migrations.

### Partial solution

Tools like [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) can automate deployment scenarios and run from your local environnement. To work successfully they need a configuration and have to be ran manually everytime you want to deploy your website.

On the other hand, there are paid tools like [Envoyer.io](https://envoyer.io) that offer a higher level of automation by performing the deployment online, in a completely automated way for each push you do. Problem, these services are not free, or some with a free-tier which limits the number of projects.
